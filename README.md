Welcome to the official repository for Project Da Vinci - an online banking application for the fictional bank *DV Bank*.<br />

We are 4 2nd year IT students at graduating from the NSCC Institute of Technology in 2020.<br />

Our goal is to build a web application capable of demonstrating our ability to self-teach and adapt to using new technologies and techniques. We will be producing consistent deliverables to showcase our progress, and will be hosting the application publicly upon its completion.
